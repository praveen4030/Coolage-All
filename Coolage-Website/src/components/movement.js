                <h3>Coolage The Movement :</h3>
                <p>
                  We see a future where applications such as coolage form a
                  closely-knit self-supporting community that communicates with
                  each other and supports the enterprises which are thriving
                  within. In the COVID pandemic, we saw the side-effects of over
                  globalization and concentration of production facilities.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  With the governmentâ€™s push for an Atma Nirbhar Bharat, we want
                  to make the colleges competitive in the digital age by
                  supporting in-house businesses.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We are working on this vision and eventually expand corporate
                  campuses, residential townships, and societies.
